Subject: [PATCH 1/4] futex: Return error code instead of assigning it without
 effect
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The check on the rt_waiter and top_waiter->pi_state is assigning an error
return code to ret but this later gets re-assigned, hence the check is
ineffective.

Return -EINVAL rather than assigning it to ret which was the original
intent.

Fixes: dc7109aaa233 ("futex: Validate waiter correctly in futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()")
Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
