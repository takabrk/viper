Subject: [PATCH] locking: Remove rt_rwlock_is_contended()

rt_rwlock_is_contended() has not users. It makes no sense to use it as
rwlock_is_contended() because it is a sleeping lock on RT and preemption
is possible. It reports always != 0 if used by a writer and even if
there is a waiter then the lock might not be handed over if the
current owner has the highest priority.

Remove rt_rwlock_is_contended().
