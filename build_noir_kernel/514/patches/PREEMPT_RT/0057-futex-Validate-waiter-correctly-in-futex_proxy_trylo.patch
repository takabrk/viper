Subject: [PATCH 57/72] futex: Validate waiter correctly in
 futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()

The loop in futex_requeue() has a sanity check for the waiter, which is
missing in futex_proxy_trylock_atomic(). In theory the key2 check is
sufficient, but futexes are cursed so add it for completeness and paranoia
sake.
